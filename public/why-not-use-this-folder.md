# Public folder

See: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#src-vs-public


> We recommend that local images are kept in src/ when possible so that Astro can transform, optimize and bundle them. Files in the /public directory are always served or copied into the build folder as-is, with no processing.

> Your local images stored in src/ can be used by all files in your project: .astro, .md, .mdx, .mdoc, and other UI frameworks. Images can be stored in any folder, including alongside your content.

> Store your images in the public/ folder if you want to avoid any processing or to have a direct public link to them.
